I wrote a slide deck for work for internal training on Ansible. 
I've created a [public-facing version](/ansible-training).

In [Ansible Weekly](https://devopsu.com/newsletters/ansible-weekly-newsletter.html) [Issue 35](https://devopsu.com/newsletters/ansible-weekly/35.html) there
was a link to an [Ansible Crash Course](http://www.slideshare.net/SimoneSoldateschi/ansible-crash-course-35783512). Which might make things even simpler.
